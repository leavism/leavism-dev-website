Hello world, my name is Huy and I spent my Spring break learning the T3 stack. Or mainly just the NextJS part of it. I have previous experience using Prisma ORM, but haven't implemented any kind of database for this website yet. Maybe I will for a comment section.

Which leads me to my next point, what else is this website missing? I guess I can make a quick check list here and see if I ever get to them:

* [ ] Replace remark with react-markdown
* [ ] Comment section for blog posts
* [ ] Projects page
* [ ] More customization to add character to website
* [ ] A dark mode

That's it for now. Here's a picture of my mom's dog :)
