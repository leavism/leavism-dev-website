Hello world, my name is Huy and I spent my Spring break learning the T3 stack. Well, mainly just the Next.js part.

# Why the T3 Stack?
The [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) is a web stack focused on full stack typesafety. It's axioms include modularity (even though it's very opinionated), responsibility, and typesafety. I'm not too convinced on what they have to say about the first two points, but I can *really* get behind their emphasis on typesafety. The `create-t3-app` CLI is a quick way to start a new full-stack, ðŸ”’**typesafe**ðŸ”’ web app, and it's typesafe all the way through baby.

As a beginner with little to no experience in web development, picking a stack to learn is like playing Russian roulette with my time and energy. The stack I learn today could be obselete by tomorrow. Like there's a [V3 stack](https://create-v3-app.vercel.app/) now and it's supposedly 10000000x better than the T3 stack sheeeesh ðŸ’¦

Jokes aside, I gravitated towards T3 because it was centered around typesafety. It's always risky to learn a new technology, but I can safely bet on learning and developing my understanding in CS concepts like typesafety.

# So now what?
I think React looks butt ugly. I mean just look at this code:

**And it used to be worse!** I don't blame React though. Ternaries already look ugly, and then you mix HTML into it and you have yourself spaghetti stains on the carpet.

Besides that, I'm a bit overwhelmed by React. I still don't understand what hooks and routes/routers are yet. But I know what a component is ðŸ˜­. Added to React, I need to learn how Next.js does data fetching and when/how to use the different rendering methods. I know nothing about auths and APIs, and I have a little bit of experience using Prisma on my [Discord bot](https://github.com/leavism/Baeshaza). I also practiced a little bit of Tailwind CSS making this site.

All of this leads to my next point, what else is this website missing? I guess I can make a quick check list here and see if I ever get to them:

### Website todo

* [ ] **Implement Discord authentication** and learn NextAuth along the way.
* [ ] **Comment section for blog posts** and learn Next.js's SSR.
* [ ] **More customization to add character to website**â€“ and get my Tailwind CSS on awwww yeah.
* [ ] **A dark mode** for more Tailwind CSS practice.
* [ ] **Projects page**
* [x] ~~**Replace remark with react-markdown** (maybe?)~~ March 28: That was easier than expected

That's it for now. Here's a picture of my mom's dog ðŸ‘‹
