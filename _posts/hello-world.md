Hello world, my name is Huy and I spent my Spring break learning Next.js.

# Why Next.js?
I've heard for years now that you shouldn't learn React by itself. Funny enough, the React team recently updated [their docs](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) to say the exact same thing (just a few days before I wrote this post). And wouldn't you know it, Next.js is first on the React team's list of recommended frameworks. It's versatile in that I can create an app of any size, like this mostly static website blog!

Okay but why React with Next.js and not Vue with Nuxt.js? Personal preference, that's why.

## The T3 Stack
As a college student with little to no experience in web development, picking a stack to learn is like playing Russian roulette with my time and energy. The stack I learn today could be obselete by tomorrow, or more likely completely irrelevant when I start working. At the least, I wanted a stack that included Next.js and supported TypeScript.

*Enter stage right*: [the T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/), who's core pieces include Next.js, TypeScript, and almost always Tailwind CSS. If you're wondering why it's call the T3 stack when there's only two T's from Tailwind and TypeScript, you aren't alone. Turns out the guy who originally used the stack just named it after himself, [Theo](https://t3.gg/blog). In my opinion, it's barely a stack when you consider Next.js supports TypeScript out of the box and Tailwind is just an optional CSS framework. So if the stack really only consists of Next.js, is it really a stack? I don't know for sure, but I think I know why it's so convoluted.

Its axioms include modularity, responsibility, and typesafety. Although it touts itself to be modular, the T3 stack really *really* wants you to deploy it on Vercel and run it with tRPC, Prisma, and Auth.js. Now it's looking a lot more like a full web stack, but because it's trying to stay minimal and modular, the T3 stack is just Next.js.

Now here's the reason why I chose to work with the pretentiously named "T3 stack." The `create-t3-app` CLI is probably the quickest way to start a new full-stack, ðŸ”’**typesafe**ðŸ”’ web app, and it's typesafe all the way through baby. I can't be on the fact that Next.js will stay around forever, but I can practice concepts like typesafety and expect those to carry with me throughout my career.

# So now what?
I'm a bit overwhelmed by React. There's a lot to learn and read with so little time. React just came out with server components, which I assume is more than just a new feature but a change in philosophy as well. Does this mean *even more* to learn down the road? These are exciting times for React users, but again, I'm **very overwhelmed** right now.

All of this leads to my next point, what else is this website missing? I guess I can make a quick check list here and see if I ever get to them:

### Website todo

* [x] ~~**Implement Discord authentication** and learn Auth.js along the way.~~ March 31: Learned a bit about how to use Auth.js, but not satisfied. Will consider adding a LinkedIn auth later down the line.
* [ ] **Comment section for blog posts** and learn Next.js's SSR.
* [ ] **More customization to add character to my website**â€“ and get my Tailwind on **awwww yeah**.
* [x] ~~**A dark mode** for more Tailwind CSS practice.~~ April 4: Tailwind made this easy
* [ ] **Projects page**
* [ ] **Move this list to a separate page**
* [x] ~~**Replace remark with react-markdown** (maybe?)~~ March 28: That was easier than expected

That's it for now. Here's a picture of my mom's dog ðŸ‘‹
