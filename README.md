# Next.js Blog
A simple Next.js web application to web development. It was my first React based web app and I learned quite a lot! Here are some of my big takeaways:
- Proper use of SSR and SSG
- Component based design and development for web applications
- Utility-first CSS with TailwindCSS
- End-to-end typesafety design with TypeScript and tRPC
- Basic layout design (prototyping in Figma before implementing it here)
